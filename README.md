# üçï Find Free Food üçï

A free food finder for hungry students, student athletes, and everyone in between. [findfreefood.org](https://findfreefood.org)

Built for [Pickhacks](https://pickhacks.io/) 2019 ü§ô

## Inspiration

As perpetually hungry college students, we saw a need for providing people like us with information regarding where students could get free food on campus. From student organization meetings to speaker series, there's always free food somewhere. And who could benefit more from lots of free food than **student athletes** who just got done with a killer workout??

## What it does

The application displays a map of locations where you can find free food on campus. You can click through different food options to get information about them and who is offering the food.

## How we built it

Our front-end was built using `React` and our back-end was built using 'GraphQL`. We also made use of the Google Maps API & Google Cloud. Caffeinated chocolate helped along the way too.

## Challenges we ran into

Most of the team was somewhat inexperienced with `React` so we have been learning it along the way. We had some issues getting the server up and running but managed to get it spun up. It was also a pain integrating the back-end with the user interface.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're really happy with the user interface's look & feel. We also are excited with the prospect that this might help us and others find more free food on campus.

## What we learned

We learned a LOT about `React`, website deployment, and that hackathons are a lot of fun.

## What's next for Find Free Food

We are going to eat some free food üôè

But seriously, integration with SnapChat would be interesting, as well as making the app more robust in general. We would also like to add more features to the UI like actually being able to add entries to the list of events.
